Hi thank you for looking at this github repository. 

This repository is the supplementary information for Sub- and Super-Nernstian Tafel Slopes Can Result from Reversible Electron Transfer Coupled to Either Preceding or Following Chemical Reaction published at Journal of Electrical Analytical Chemsitry.
The set use C++ progra should be run a windows machine because the window.h header is used to get system time. 

Because std::thread is used, only C++ 11 and above can be used. 


Before running the program, look into the code and file the file path to store the result simulations. The file path are located in helper.cpp and main.cpp.
